Capstone Project

We Watch

Creators - Osasenaga && Corinna 

Background

With the increased popularity of using streaming services, more Canadians are using multiple platforms to watch their favourite programs. With accounts on so many platforms, it can be a challenge to keep track of which program a user has watched, who they have watched it with, and which episode they are currently on.


Our solution is a one-stop, platform agnostic sidekick application that will solve a user’s streaming woes at a glance. Once logged in, a user can do all of the following:
	- View programs they have already watched;
	- This includes show title, season, and last-watched episode
	- Quickly identify which platform the program was viewed on;
	- Keep track of friends and family a user has watched with;
